# gosfem
Being free, open source and flexible, Gosfem can morph to meet the needs of a huge range of schools.

Gosfem was founded in March 2020 in response to a lack of powerful, usable and open source school platforms. Right from the beginning, Gosfem was designed to be flexible, extensible and themeable, whilst aiming to help teachers to do their jobs.

The project aims to provide all schools, no matter their size or resources they have, with the systems they need to provide effective learning, teaching and school management. Gosfem is built using PHP, MySQL, jQuery and other open tools.
